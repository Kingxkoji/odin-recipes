   <h2> Description</h2>
   <p> 

    Cheeseburgers embody the quintessential American fast food, marrying 
    the hearty flavors of a juicy beef patty with the creamy, melted bliss of cheese. 
    Originating in the early 20th century, the cheeseburger has evolved into a beloved culinary icon, celebrated for its simplicity 
    and versatility. At its core, a cheeseburger consists of a ground beef patty nestled between a soft bun, crowned with a slice of 
    cheese—typically cheddar, American, or Swiss. Variations abound, allowing for an array of toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, 
    pickles, and an assortment of condiments to complement the rich flavors. The cheeseburger's universal appeal lies in its ability to be 
    customized to suit individual tastes, making it a staple at cookouts, diners, 
    and fast-food restaurants worldwide. Its enduring 
    popularity attests to the irresistible combination of 
    beef and cheese, a duo that continues to captivate the taste buds of millions.

<h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80% lean and 20% fat) </li> 
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split and toasted </li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves </li>
        <li>Tomato slices </li>
        <li> Red onion slices</li>
        <li> Cheese slices (cheddar, Swiss, American, or your choice)</li>
        <li> Pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or any preferred sauces </li>
    </ul>
<h3> <strong> Steps <strong</h3>
    <ol> <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Avoid overmixing to keep the patties tender.
        Divide the mixture into 4 equal parts and form into patties, about ¾ inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        
        
       <li>  Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush the grill or pan with a little oil to prevent sticking.
        Place the patties on the grill or pan, cooking for about 3-4 minutes on one side until browned and slightly charred.
        Flip the patties and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare, or longer for your desired doneness. If using cheese, add a slice on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.</li>
      
        
       <li> Start with the bottom half of the toasted buns. You can spread a little butter on the buns before toasting for extra flavor.
        Place a lettuce leaf on each bun bottom, followed by the cooked patty with cheese.
        Add tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles as desired.
        Apply your preferred sauces (ketchup, mustard, mayo) on the top half of the bun.
        Cap each burger with the top half of the bun. </li>
        
        
       
      <li>Serve the burgers immediately while they're still warm. Accompany with sides like fries, chips, or a salad for a complete meal.<li>
    </ol>
